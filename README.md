## haskybook
An application to create HTML files for static webpage documents written in markdown syntax. We hope this will be an
easy user-friendly documentation generator from markdown files. The user needs
to give a content markdown file which lists out the pages of the documentation.
Every file will be converted to HTML pages and titles will be automatically linked
to contents, and available as a sidebar thus creating a web-based documentation
book.
