The conversion would be done using a parsec library in Haskell which uses monadic parser combinators. Parsec is defined as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the input stream type. </p><p><strong>STEP 2 </strong></p><p>Our next step will be implementing the restructuring of HTML files to enable the comprehensive documentation including content sidebar. This would allow a static website with connected pages. Along with the contents of each file we will give a  <em>Table of contents </em>which will automatically generate the contents and each page corresponding to the title in there. </p></div>
